Patient Health Record (PHR) Management System

This project is a full-stack Patient Health Record (PHR) Management System designed to manage medical records and appointments using role-based access control. The application provides separate dashboards for patients and hospital staff, ensuring secure and structured access to healthcare data. The frontend is built with React.js and Tailwind CSS, offering a responsive and user-friendly interface, while the backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js to handle authentication and RESTful API communication. The system supports secure login, protected routing, record uploads, and appointment scheduling. A database layer is integrated to store user information, patient records, and appointment details, following real-world healthcare application architecture. This project demonstrates strong understanding of full-stack development, frontend–backend integration, and role-based system design.
